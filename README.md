A sophisticated team-based combat simulation built in C++ utilizing the GLUT graphics library. This project implements advanced artificial intelligence concepts including A* pathfinding algorithms and Finite State Machines (FSM) to create autonomous intelligent agents that can make decisions based on their environment and role.

## Features

### Advanced AI Implementation
- **A* Pathfinding**: Efficient navigation through complex terrain
- **Finite State Machines**: Dynamic behavior switching based on environmental conditions
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Agents can independently assess situations and take appropriate actions

### Intelligent Agent Roles
- **Soldiers**: Combat-focused units with offensive capabilities
- **Supporters**: Resource management and tactical support units
- Each role exhibits specialized behaviors and decision-making priorities

### Strategic Team Behaviors
- **Team Coordination**: Units communicate and work together toward common objectives
- **Dynamic Resource Management**: Intelligent allocation and distribution of resources
- **Adaptive Combat Tactics**: Units adjust strategies based on battlefield conditions
- **Contextual Decision Making**: Actions are influenced by situational awareness

## Technical Details

### Architecture
The simulation is built around a multi-agent system where each unit operates via its own decision-making process while maintaining awareness of team objectives.
